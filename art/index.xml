      <description>3D Modeling 1. Morning Room Set February 6, 2020
Program: Maya
For this personal project, I wanted to create a scene of a workroom/playroom in the early morning hours. To light the scene, I used V-Ray sun and rectangle lights. I also played around with the cameraâ€™s ISO value to make the scene brighter. All of the objects were modeled by hand.
Later on, I would love to add color/textures to the objects and use V-Ray Environmental Fog to create sunbeams.</description>
