      <description>Journey Through a Nebula Description: I wanted to create the illusion of moving through a stellar nursery. For the main star in the center, I deformed the vertices using low frequency Worley noise with a layer of high frequency FBM on the top. I used a rotation matrix and several offsets based on sin and cos to continuously move the vertices over time. I colored the icosphere by mapping the FBM value to a fiery color gradient.</description>
